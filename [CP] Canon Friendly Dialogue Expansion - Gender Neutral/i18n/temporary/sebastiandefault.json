  "CDE_Sebastian_fall_Sun4":"A lot of people seem self-obsessed. Some can't get into a book or TV show if the characters don't remind them of themselves.#$b#The exact opposite of that is why I like reading fantasy.",
  "CDE_Sebastian_fall_Sun6":"People act completely different in big groups. They all put on this mask, this persona...#$b#...and it's just so other people will accept them.#$b#Don't they get a little too comfortable losing touch with the real version of themselves?",

  "CDE_Sebastian_winter_Sat4":"You must not spend very much time at home, with the way you're always running around.#$e#Sounds exhausting.",
  "CDE_Sebastian_winter_Sat8":"I'm always confused why the idea of an afterlife is so appealing. Do people realize how long 'eternity' actually is?#$e#I understand the need for comfort, but...#$b#...to me, thinking about 'eternity' is more like staring into an endless abyss. I'd rather focus on what's temporary and in front of me.",
  "CDE_Sebastian_winter_Sat10":"Man, I've got to move out of here, fast.#$e#Anything new on your farm, despite the snow?",
  "CDE_Sebastian_winter_Sun4":"I built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it.#$b#You know your life's going in reverse when your stepdad treats you like a six-year-old.$u",

  "CDE_Sebastian_patio_1": "Need something? I'll just be over here working on my bike for a while.",
