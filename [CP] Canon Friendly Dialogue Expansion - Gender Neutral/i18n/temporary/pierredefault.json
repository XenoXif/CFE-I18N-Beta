  "CDE_Pierre_Mon8":"$d Joja#Well, at least some residents of our town believe in supporting local businesses. ...*sigh*$s|I'll admit, work's actually a little more fun without JojaMart around. ...It all seems like it matters again, knowing it won't end in ruin, y'know?",  
  "CDE_Pierre_Mon4":"Hi, @. Need any seeds or fruit tree saplings?",
  "CDE_Pierre_Mon2":"How is the farm?#$e#I think we could really have a nice business setup, you and me.#$b#So I hope you stick around!",
  "CDE_Pierre_Tue10":"$d Joja#Apparently, the mom-and-pop grocer in Grampleton closed not too long ago. I wonder when it's gonna be my turn?$s|I did some research. Turns out JojaMart was selling at quite a loss. Their general strategy isn't even to turn a profit until after the local businesses are extinguished.",
  "CDE_Pierre_Tue2":"Hey, glad to see you again!#$e#Thanks for supporting the local economy!",

  "CDE_Pierre_Fri8":"$d Joja#Everything that Morris does is technically legal, but it doesn't change the fact that he sees our town for its money and nothing else.$3|My stress nightmares about JojaMart have finally stopped. ...Did I tell you I'd been having nightmares? Yeah, that was a thing.",  
  "CDE_Pierre_Fri6":"I've thought about writing stories to pass the time. Nothing really gets me inspired, though.#$e#I don't know how Elliott does what he does.#$e#Maybe I need a change of scenery.",
  "CDE_Pierre_Sat6":"Sometimes it's tough making dinner conversation with my family. At the end of the day, all that's on my mind are order forms, profits, sales...$s#$e#I guess I can see how that'd be boring...$s#$b#But at any rate, a man has to do what's necessary for his family, regardless of whether they can appreciate it or not.",,
  "CDE_Pierre_Sat4":"Sometimes, operating a small business really takes it out of you.#$b#But I wonder, what would this community be like without my store?",

  "CDE_Pierre_winterMon8":"The thing about gridball is that it's all about giving it 110%.#$e#The other team only gave it 108%, though, so that's why they didn't score more goal points.#$e#Hehehe... sorry.$h",
  "CDE_Pierre_winterMon4_inlaw_Abigail":"I used to worry about Abigail's future, but I can see that she's wound up exactly where she needs to be.#$e#You be good to each other now, alright?$h",

  "CDE_Pierre_Fri4+summerSun10":"With her online classes, Abigail's already formally more educated than I've ever been. I'm proud of her.#$e#I started out as a courtesy clerk as a kid, and then I worked my way up until I could open this store.",
