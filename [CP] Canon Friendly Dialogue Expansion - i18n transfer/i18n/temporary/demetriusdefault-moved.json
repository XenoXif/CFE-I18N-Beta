  "CDE_Demetrius_spring1y2": "Happy new year! Lots of work ahead of both of us.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_summer28": "You got my letter, right? Don't be late! You won't want to wait a whole 'nother year for it.$h",
  "CDE_Demetrius_winter28": "We've completed another rotation around the sun!#$e#That deserves a celebration, it seems.",

  //heart specific dialogue
  "CDE_Demetrius_summerMon6": "Why is it that ice cream tastes so good? Science may never provide an answer.#$e#Ha ha, just kidding. It's the fat and sugar.$h",
  "CDE_Demetrius_summerTue8": "You can use sap and fish to make quality fertilizer.#$e#If it's too time consuming to get the fish, maybe you could catch some snails or periwinkles in some crab pots instead.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_summerThu8": "I became a scientist because I wanted to contribute to the progression of our species.#$e#Of course, none of this would be possible without farmers such as yourself.$h",
  "CDE_Demetrius_summerThu4": "Hmm... If strigolactone levels could be increased, would it have a proportional effect on mycorhizal growth?$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?",
  "CDE_Demetrius_summerFri10": "Good news, @! I've had an article published in Environmental Science Quarterly!$h#$b#I'd say it's relevant to any modern farmer.#$e#It's all about my recent findings on the reaction of a fertile soil's bacillus toward fungal phytopathogens.#$b#Fascinating stuff!$h",
  "CDE_Demetrius_summerFri2": "$p 40#So I heard Maru had you look through that telescope out back.|If you and Maru become friends, I'm sure she'll show you how to use that telescope out back.#$e#Pretty exciting, huh?",
  "CDE_Demetrius_summerSat10": "I hope my research will contribute to better, more sustainable use of the environment's resources.#$e#Finding a use for the cave on your farm would be one small example.",

  "CDE_Demetrius_fallMon10": "Remember, there's a thriving ecosystem living right there in your farm's soil. Be sure to take good care of it.#$e#I'd argue the soil is far more amazing than even the plants that grow from it. Especially this time of year!#$b#Why, just right now the azotobacter levels are soaring, providing phenomenal nitrogen fixation for the plants. Not to mention the rhizobium...$h#$e#...Robin isn't too terribly interested in this topic.$s",
  "CDE_Demetrius_fallTue10": "The more we pull resources from a variety of locations, the less we have to take from each place.#$b#There's an ecological incentive to biodiversity. We can't keep this world running on factory-like monocultures.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_fallThu6": "Maru sure spends a lot of time working on those gadgets of hers.#$e#I'm glad she's so dedicated.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_fallFri10": "Hmm, I was looking through my microscope at a soil sample from your farm. I found some strange, sparkling phenomena.$s#$b#Then when I looked back less than a minute later, I was unable to find it again.$s#$e#The good news is that your soil is quite healthy. Thriving, really.#$b#But I wish I knew what it was that I saw.$s",

  "CDE_Demetrius_winterSun10": "There's likely a naturalistic explanation for every phenomenon.#$b#Even things like love, or spirituality, or the origin of the world perhaps may be explained with science.#$e#Some say that takes the wonder out of the universe.#$b#Myself? I don't think so. If anything. it increases my awe for existence.",

  "CDE_Demetrius_Mon10": "I can already see Maru's scientific achievements surpassing mine in her future.#$e#I'm very lucky that she's turning out the way she is.$h",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Mon8": "If you've ever wondered why your crops grow well, it has to do primarily with the healthy rhizobium living in your soil.#$e#Long story short, you need a diverse ecosystem to have a high-quality farm.#$b#Corporate farms grow less-nutritious produce when they level an entire forest and replace it with a monoculture.$s",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Mon6": "I know that Maru will have to leave the valley eventually. If she got stuck here for too long, it could hinder her potential.$s#$e#For the moment, though, I think her living here works out well.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Mon4": "I'm happy Maru got her job at the clinic. Medicine is a very respectable profession, but I'll be happy with whatever kind of science she ultimately decides upon.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Mon2": "Maru worked hard to get through school early. Now she's studying a variety of sciences independently.#$e#I'm glad that I can provide her the equipment she needs to pursue her future.$h",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Tue8": "Have you ever visited Calico Desert?#$e#I was more interested in studying the valley's ecosystem, but the fact that we have a desert just a day trip's drive away has remained quite a mystery.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Tue6": "The drastic changes between the seasons are crucial for keeping the wildlife migrating...#$b$...which in turn is crucial for preventing one single population from becoming too dominant.#$e#I keep pretty good tabs on the various local species, so I'll let you know if I see anything unusual.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Tue4": "Exploring the mines could be interesting, but my fields are ecology and biochemistry, rather than geology.#$e#If we found evidence indicating a significant causal link between the mines and the vegetation up here, well then that would be another story.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Tue2": "Stardew Valley continues to impress me with the diversity of its flora and fauna.#$e#I'm surprised there weren't any other scientists observing the area before I arrived.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Wed10": "Sorry, I must talk your ear off from time to time, don't I?",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Wed8": "Whenever my field research becomes a bit stagnating, I'll admit that I enjoy a little off-the-wall chemistry.#$e#I got my hands on a little cesium a few years ago. Robin said \"never again.\"$h",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Wed6": "I've been collecting some useful data from that cave on your farm.#$b#It's unique in that it produces flora that are often unavailable in the direct surrounding environment.#$e#We're still years away from determining how to utilize this, though.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Wed4": "Hi @! How are you doing today?#$e#I wish I could make your farming job easier somehow.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Thu6": "It's no wonder that humans have been farming in this region for countless generations. It takes an environment like this for early man to thrive.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Thu4": "There are a variety of sponsors who support my work. It took several years of publication and networking to be able to set up my lab out here.#$e#I did have my sights on Stardew Valley for quite a while.$h",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Thu2": "Growing any green beans? One of my favorite comfort foods uses them in a recipe.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Fri10": "I can't help but analyze the 'why' of everything. The way plants grow, the way food tastes, the reason good art looks beautiful.#$e#But every once in a while, I recognize the need to detach, stop questioning, and simply dance with my wife.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Fri4": "Robin has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$e#...now if I could only quantify her mood levels, perhaps I could model the fluctuations using a sinusoidal curve...$u",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Sat10": "Have you heard of giant crops? Apparently, if certain crops become so dominant in a wide enough plot of land, there's a small chance for the giant variant to manifest.#$e#Nature almost bred them out of existence, since their size makes them impractical for natural selection.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Sat6": "Greetings, @. How is your work progressing?#$e#If you grow any pristine crops, it would be a privilege to examine them.#$e#And possibly taste them, too!$h#$b#...For science.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Sat4": "One aim of my research is to figure out the exact environmental conditions that we see here in the valley, that make it so uniquely fertile for such a wide variety of species.#$e#In terms of application, we could use it to bolster the abundance of crop turnouts in less fertile regions.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Sun10": "Between you and me, I really thought that Sebastian would have moved out by now.$s#$e#He's even older than I was when I first met Robin...$s#$e#As long as he works and pays his rent, though...",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Sun8": "Sebastian always seems bored by just about every aspect of my work.$s#$e#Computer science is a science, though. I've always tried to bond with him over that, but there's still a bit of a divide between us.#$e#The books I've read say that's to be expected.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Sun6": "For Sebastian, I left most of the parenting to Robin.#$e#Even today, it's usually best to stay out of his way and let Robin handle things with him.",
  "CDE_Demetrius_Sun4": "My work basically is my hobby. Occasionally, though, I'll cook a meal, too.",
