  "CDE_Krobus_Mon6":"My friends and I have largely been shunned by our kind, for attempting to suppress our chaotic nature.#$e#But I cannot declare myself better than the violent ones. A life is a life.#$e#Please, even if you have slain any violent ones, I do not wish to know.",
  "CDE_Krobus_Mon4":"...Have you encountered others like me, in the mines? I'm sorry if they were hostile towards you. You see, we've learned to fear humans... there have been too many... unpleasant encounters.$s#$e#You haven't... slain any of my friends, have you?$3",
  "CDE_Krobus_Tue10":"@, I have grown quite amiable of your frequent visits here.#$e#It is strange. Until recently, I never would have even considered friendship with a human.",  
  "CDE_Krobus_Tue8":"Rasmodius is a good man. He is one of the few humans besides you whom I would trust.#$e#His worldview is in much better alignment with reality than most humans'.",
  "CDE_Krobus_Tue6":"Yes, I call this place my home.#$e#I did not have a place to call my home for quite some time.",

  "CDE_Krobus_Tue2":"So you farm for a living? I occasionally carry a product that might help you. Check back on Friday.",

  "CDE_Krobus_fallSun10":"We shadow beings don't grow old. We can \"pass away,\" though not in the same way as your kind.#$e#With time, we slowly dissolve until we are indistinguishable from the darkness once again.#$b#Some time later, a new shadow being hatches from the darkness.$h",

  "CDE_Krobus_winterTue10":"It's too cold for the tiny bugs to survive. My food supply is a bit short.$s",
  "CDE_Krobus_winterSat10":"I carry mixed feelings about my species. On one hand, I'm ashamed of the chaos we've caused. It's simply in our nature.$3#$b#But we're not all violent. And my kin, my origin... it's who I am. I can't just forsake where I come from, can I?$3",
