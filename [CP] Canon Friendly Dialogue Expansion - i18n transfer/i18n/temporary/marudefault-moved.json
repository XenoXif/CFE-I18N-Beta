  "CDE_Maru_winterSun10": "Time travel is theoretically possible.#$b#But even if I could travel through time, I wouldn't want to change anything.$l",
  "CDE_Maru_winterSun8": "Time travel is theoretically possible. It would just take more energy than anyone can harness.#$e#We're talking... pretty much all the kinetic and potential energy in the world. In one place.",
  "CDE_Maru_winterSun6": "Hey, nice running into you. How was your week?",
  "CDE_Maru_winterSun4": "I get so sleepy when it's cold...",

  "CDE_Maru_Tue10": "It's important to sit back and enjoy the finer things in life.#$e#Sometimes, my brain starts going a mile a minute and it gets overwhelming.#$b#But thankfully, I've managed to settle down now.",
  "CDE_Maru_Tue8": "My mom's always been really supportive of me in my pursuits. So has my dad.#$e#I don't think I would've done as well if I'd had anyone else as parents.",

  "CDE_Maru_Wed6": "The heart monitor in the clinic's treatment room could really use a few improvements.#$b#It wouldn't be too hard to install a voice command system on it. That's just one thing.#$e#It's just wishful thinking, though. I know I can't tamper with standardized medical equipment.$s",
  "CDE_Maru_Wed4": "Dr. Harvey was about to throw out his defibrillator, but I opened it and fixed it up no problem.#$e#Unfortunately, he still had to replace it. Something about protocol and avoiding lawsuits...$s",
  "CDE_Maru_Wed2": "Days at the clinic are nice when I get to learn something new.#$e#If I don't learn something new every day, the day just ends up feeling incomplete.",
