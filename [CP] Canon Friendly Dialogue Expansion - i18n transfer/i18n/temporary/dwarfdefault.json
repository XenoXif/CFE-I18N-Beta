  "CDE_Dwarf_repeated_3": "The old way of my life is gone. I must connect with humans, but I also do not think your species would receive me well if I walked through the town.#$e#The light outside would drive me crazy in a matter of minutes, too.",

  "CDE_Dwarf_Mon8": "You keep coming back here. Do you... like bombs?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Mon6": "When you humans had your mining operation below, I had to be very crafty to evade detection.#$e#Obviously, I don't care much about that anymore. I humbly welcome you here.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Mon4": "I got some of this stuff from the surface. I just take it from your people during the night.#$e#Hmm? What is this concept you call \"private property\"?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Mon2": "My name? My people have never used names.#$e#No, it isn't confusing. Frankly, I would have a harder time trying to remember a different name for every person I've met.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Tue10": "I don't think I survived the Elemental Wars because of my bravery. On the contrary, the only thing I was ever good at was hiding.#$e#I'm not proud of that fact.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Tue8": "You thought Dwarves had long beards? But... I do have a long beard. Can't you see it?#$e#What, a beard like the gray-haired human has? Well his isn't just long, it's excessive.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Tue6": "Occasionally, I see a gray-haired human come through here.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Tue4": "Ah... cave carrot stew, cave carrot roast, cave carrot soup and cave carrots au gratin.#$e#...And a ramekin of cave carrot brulee to sweeten the night.#$e#What?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Tue2": "When was I born? Well, some time ago. It was...#$b#...wait, when would that be on your calendar?#$b#Some time in late \"summer,\" I think. Summer 22?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Wed10": "Of course I need money. Why would I sell my products for free?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Wed4": "Long ago, my people knew the secrets of advanced technology. The archaeological evidence proves that.#$e#But I wonder where it came from? And where did it all go? I have some ideas, but not the complete story...",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Wed2": "You're only how many years old?#$b#Ah, yes, I apologize. In a dwarven lifespan, you would still be a child.#$e#I hope you take no offense.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Thu10": "I humbly thank you for your continued visits. You have made me consider humans differently since you showed up.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Thu6": "Most floors in the mines have become unlivable. Too many monsters.#$e#Living up here will have to do, though.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Thu4": "I feel most comfortable underground.#$e#The deeper underground, the better.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Thu2": "Yes, I live alone. I have no family. You can thank the shadow brutes for that.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Fri8": "Zzzzzz... Oh?#$e#My apologies. I usually delve into the mines during your night and I sleep at some point during your day. What do you need?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Fri6": "My language is so much easier than what humans speak. You learned enough to have this conversation with me fairly quickly, did you not?#$e#Nonetheless, your skills are praiseworthy for a newcomer.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Fri4": "Please inform me if you find any precious stones in the mine.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Fri2": "Most humans fear the unknown... that's why I've hidden my shop here.#$e#Your mining skills prove you're trustworthy.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Sat8": "Explosives are only dangerous if you are a fool. I have used things like these since my earliest days.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Sat6": "The mines can be a treacherous place. Be careful, friend.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Sat4": "I am happy to receive any dwarven artifacts that you find. But seeing them does fill me with a bit of sadness, too.#$e#I can't offer you any reward for them, but... just so you know.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Sat2": "So you're a farmer, then? Do you raise any slimes?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Sun8": "You are without a doubt the one human I have spoken to more than any other.#$e#I was always taught to stay away from humans, but I am glad that I decided to shun that rule.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Sun4": "One day you'll have to tell me about this beverage you call \"milk\".",
  "CDE_Dwarf_Sun2": "I am willing to try human cuisine, yes. Why don't you bring some by?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_summerMon10": "I feel much more secure inside. When I step out under your open sky, I feel almost as if I could fall into it.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_summerTue10": "You have devices called... computers? Ah yes, I think I know what you mean.#$b#You can thank my ancestors' ingenuity for giving humans the idea.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_summerThu10": "My ancestors were capable of taming massive dragons. Or so I heard long ago.#$b#In truth, I have no evidence that it is true. It could merely be a tale.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_summerFri10": "There are other cave systems around the world where other dwarves dwell. But I have not seen them with my own eyes for a long time.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_summerSat10": "In the future, if there are no dwarves to carry on our legacy, then I suppose it must be up to humans like you.#$b#Please be good to the underground.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_summerSun10": "The volcanic activity in this mountain is increasing. Your kind may want to watch out when it erupts.#$e#I predict it will happen in about four thousand years.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_fallWed10": "Humans make a lot of garbage, hmm? Where else does it come from?#$e#I wasn't talking about you. I meant the other humans.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_fallThu10": "There was a thriving Dwarvish civilization near a volcano south of here.#$e#I assume it must lie in ruins now.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_fallFri10": "The gray and white parts of the sky... you call those... clouds?#$e#How interesting.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_fallSat10": "You seem like an ambitious type. Please be careful with the power you weild, or you will become a monster yourself.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_fallSun10": "...#$b#You are... a kind person.#$b#...#$b#I have not said that to anyone in many years.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_winterMon10": "Strange things have begun to happen in the mines. Dangerous hordes of monsters, odd environments...#$b#Could that strange blue human be involved?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_winterTue10": "You can find rare fish in the lakes down below. Have you heard of the Lava Eel and the Ice Pip?#$e#Only an expert angler could catch them.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_winterWed10": "All old things pass into new. My civilization has crumbled. But I do not wish to be discarded.#$e#I have a near endless supply of bombs. I will not go quietly.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_winterThu10": "Skull... cavern... beneath a desert. Yes. I believe my people spent some time there, long ago.#$e#I do not believe you will find any dwarves there now.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_winterFri10": "My people used to be legendary blacksmiths, too.#$b#But that is another art lost to the ages.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_winterSat10": "You say you can find winter root up on the surface? Perfect.#$b#It would be simple to cook a roots platter.",
  "CDE_Dwarf_winterSun10": "The hostile spirits in the shrine of death must be quite ancient.#$b#I'm sure they would be no match for you, though."

  "CDE_Dwarf_Sun": "Care to buy anything today?",
  "CDE_Dwarf_winterSun": "Ah, yes. It's true that there's a shrine of death near here. Some humans must have tunneled straight into it some time ago.#$e#I can't say exactly where it came from. Certainly not my people. And the shadow people have also denied it.#$e#Have you been there?",
