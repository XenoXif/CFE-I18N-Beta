  "CDE_Clint_rainy_2": "My shop feels even more isolated when it's raining.",
  "CDE_Clint_rainy_3": "It doesn't matter how much rain falls on my equipment outside. I can keep the furnace as hot as I need to.#$e#It's an old clunker, but it's more durable than anything they make these days.",

  //heart specific dialogue
  "CDE_Clint_Mon10": "I hate to say it, but sometimes I'm glad my father forced me to become a blacksmith. At least I have a profession.#$e#If I didn't have work to do, I'd probably spend all day just sitting around feeling sorry for myself.$s",
  "CDE_Clint_Mon8":"Maybe I was born in the wrong era. A few hundred years ago, and my skillset would've been much more respected.",
  "CDE_Clint_Mon6":"I listen to a lot of music to help pass the time. How 'bout you?#$e#Sometimes I'll sing along.#$e#What? No. You don't wanna hear me sing. Believe me.$h",
  "CDE_Clint_Mon2":"Another day, another dollar.",
  "CDE_Clint_Tue10":"Hey, @. Thanks for droppin' by.$h",
  "CDE_Clint_Tue8":"I guess I don't mind what I do for a living. It's just pretty isolating.#$e#I don't feel like I ever have anything interesting to share with the other townsfolk.",
  "CDE_Clint_Tue6":"Y'know, I'm pretty good at what I do. It's just that blacksmithing isn't the type of talent most people care about.#$e#Pff, maybe in my next life I could be a rock star.",
  "CDE_Clint_Tue4":"I've got some holes in my schedule today and tomorrow. If you want me to upgrade a tool, now's a good time for it...",
  "CDE_Clint_Tue2":"Business has been slow lately.#$e#You should upgrade your tools. I could use the cash.",
  "CDE_Clint_Wed10": "I don't know if people realize this, or care, but I do take a lot of pride in my work.#$e#I mean... When I was a boy I didn't really dream of becoming a blacksmith. But that's what I am. And I want to be the best blacksmith I can be.",
  "CDE_Clint_Wed8":"I heard there's one day a week when a shop in the desert sells omni geodes by the truckload. D'you know if that's true?",
  "CDE_Clint_Wed4":"I like making weapons, too.#$b#If you're interested, you'll have to ask Marlon up north. He's my retailer.",
  "CDE_Clint_Wed2":"Hey. Got any work for me?",
  "CDE_Clint_Thu10":"Willy's a pretty good guy. You ever talk to him?#$e#He's got things figured out pretty well. I just couldn't ever do what he does.",
  "CDE_Clint_Thu6":"My little shop is a relic left over from Pelican Town's glory days as a mining town.#$e#The only reason I could afford the place was because the mining operation was in a downward spiral.",
  "CDE_Clint_Thu4":"How did those furnace blueprints work out for you? Did you craft a furnace?#$e#Hey, I just figured it was something you could use.",
  "CDE_Clint_Fri8":"It's strange how I've been drinking Gus's beer and eating his food for years, but I barely know a thing about him.",
  "CDE_Clint_Fri4":"What kind of beer do you drink? Porter? Stout?#$e#I'm a lager man, myself.",
  "CDE_Clint_Sat10":"Did I ever show you my hands? Tough as old leather from all the calluses.#$e#When I first started working, I was worried about my hands, but now I'd say I'm proud of 'em.#$b#If a guy has messed up hands, at least he can say he's done somethin'... instead of nothin'.$h",
  "CDE_Clint_Sat4":"I gotta get outta this town. Just for a day.#$e#Grampleton's sort of my go-to place. I can't afford a fancy vacation.",
  "CDE_Clint_Sat2":"Most people would take a weekend on a day like this, wouldn't they?#$e#Me? Nope.",

  "CDE_Clint_summerWed8": "I should save up and buy a computer...#$e#Maybe I can find a girlfriend on the 'internet'...$s#$e#What? Don't judge me! Not everyone is a cool, attractive, socially-adept farmer, you know!$u#$e#What's a guy like me supposed to do? *Groan*$s",
  "CDE_Clint_summerThu10":"Hey, c'mon, you've got to admit that it was pretty fortunate for you to land in a town with its own blacksmith.$h#$e#Would you be able to get as much done on the farm otherwise?#$e#Well, I'm just glad I could find some purpose for my work. So thank you for that.",
  "CDE_Clint_summerFri6":"I remember summer vacations, back when I was in school.#$b#Heck, that was probably my favorite thing about school to begin with.$h#$e#Oh, we didn't do too much. Just hung out with my buddies. Saw movies, drove around, got into trouble.$h#$e#I think it was the freedom more than anything. You're never that free again.",
  "CDE_Clint_summerSat10":"How are your tools holding up?#$b#If they ever need repairs, just come by my shop. I guarantee these tools for life!",
  "CDE_Clint_summerSun6":"I couldn't tell you too much about the molecular properties of metal. You'd have to ask Demetrius or his daughter about that one.#$e#I just know how to make it into the shape I want.",
  "CDE_Clint_fallMon8":"Sometimes I wonder if there's anyone in this town lower on the social ladder than I am.$s#$e#Even Shane seems down pretty low, but at least he knows how to socialize if he feels like it.$s",
  "CDE_Clint_fallTue8":"My old gridball teammates... I've no idea where any of them are these days.#$e#Some of them probably wouldn't even remember me.",
  "CDE_Clint_fallWed10":"@, I gotta confess, I know I might look like a tough guy, but I just hate going into the mines.$s#$e#There's too many creepy crawlies down there...$s#$e#Just... don't let anyone else know. My secret's safe with you, right?",

  "CDE_Clint_winterTue8":"I've heard about dwarves in the mines. Not sure what I'd do if I ever saw one.#$e#Probably piss myself.$h",
  "CDE_Clint_winterWed8":"What's the purpose of life? Ahh, damn it. Don't ask me questions like that.#$e#Tried anything good at the saloon lately?",
