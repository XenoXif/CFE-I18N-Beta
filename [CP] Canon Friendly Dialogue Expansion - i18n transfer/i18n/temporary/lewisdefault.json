  "CDE_Lewis_spring23": "I sure hope the flower dance is a success again this year.#$e#Sometimes those old traditions die hard, though...$s",
  "CDE_Lewis_summer10": "I didn't sleep much last night. The luau is always the most stressful festival of the year for me.#$e#Don't let that get in the way of you having a good time, though!$h",
  "CDE_Lewis_summer28": "I think tonight's festival is my favorite because I don't have to worry about a thing. The moonlight jellies do all the work for me!$h#$e#It's a nice change of pace after the luau earlier this month.",
  "CDE_Lewis_fall15": "I take it you got my letter about the Stardew Valley Fair?#$b#This festival's my specialty. I'm sure it's going to go great.$h",
  "CDE_Lewis_fall28": "I'm not even sure how the town gets everything cleaned up after Spirit's Eve. Each year, I wake up expecting a mess, but it's like you'd never even know it happened.",

  "CDE_Lewis_Mon6": "It must be difficult to be a child in Pelican Town. There aren't as many kids as there used to be...#$e#I commissioned to have that play structure built a few years back. I hope Jas and Vincent know they're well loved here.",
  "CDE_Lewis_Mon2": "Your grandfather and I used to chat a lot about gardening. I learned a good chunk of what I know from him.",
  "CDE_Lewis_Tue8": "Our community sure has changed over the years. I remember there was an old, run-down house where the JojaMart stands today.#$e#I'm not sure if anyone even occupied that house since the time I was born. As a boy, though, I made sure to steer clear of it.",

  "CDE_Lewis_summer_Wed6": "I learned a few gardening tips from Evelyn. It's always worthwhile to spend time with a good soul like her.",

  "CDE_Lewis_fall_Thu10": "As mayor, it's important to remember I have a great deal of influence on this town.#$e#I'd like to think I'm responsible for setting the mustache trend. Have you noticed how many citizens have mustaches?#$e#I'm quite proud of myself for that one.",
  "CDE_Lewis_fall_Thu4": "Do you have any bee houses on your farm?#$e#If you place them near flowers you can get different types of honey.",
